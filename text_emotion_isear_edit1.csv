anger,"My partner without discussing with me the situation decided it Ã¡ was time for us to have a break and went ahead and arranged his Ã¡ own life for the next 6-12 months, then told me the day before it Ã¡ was about to happen having been tolerant and friendly for the Ã¡ preceding week."
sadness,"I had been living in an overseas city and made the decision to Ã¡ leave the city and come home about 12 months before I met a whole Ã¡ new set of friends, leaving them at the airport was sad and Ã¡ traumatic as they had helped me in many ways and I knew I Ã¡ wouldn't see many of them again."
fear,After I had managed to fail my first year at University I was Ã¡ scared as to what I was going to do with my future. I didn't want Ã¡ a mundane 9-5 job and yet I didn't know if I could pay my way Ã¡ through an unsubsidized year at university to settle down and Ã¡ continue my studies.
anger,This situation keeps occurring - when my little sister disagrees Ã¡ with me or vice-versa. We have very similar temperaments and I Ã¡ always end up feeling angry at her and myself for fighting so Ã¡ much over unimportant trivial matters.
sadness,"When my grandmother, who has been living with us for 14 years, Ã¡ had a stroke and was left paralysed on one side. She has been Ã¡ quite close to our family and to see her suffer in this way makes Ã¡ me feel really sad."
disgust,"A gathering of a social sports club at which they proceeded to Ã¡ show pornographic videos and then afterwards (when most people Ã¡ had had quite a bit to drink) carried on in a very degrading, Ã¡ unmoral manner - especially females exposing and flaunting Ã¡ themselves with no shame or embarassment."
shame,"Like guilt - the most ashamed I have ever felt was when I began Ã¡ to feel guilty about having sex with my boyfriend when it was Ã¡ only \the thing to do\"", and not really an act of love."""
guilt,"This feeling of guilt really applies to moral/religious views. I Ã¡ (being Catholic) went against what I was brought up to believe in Ã¡ and had a sexual relationship with my boyfriend. Many months Ã¡ later, when I was doing some deeper self analysis I began to feel Ã¡ guilty and realized that I had gone against what I wanted for Ã¡ myself and my future."
joy,My mother along with some of my friends gave me a surprise Ã¡ birthday party - they invited a large number of my friends along Ã¡ too.

anger,Because I am the Captain of a basketball team I usually organise Ã¡ a roster system so that everyone in the team can have a turn at Ã¡ doing either a duty or a ref. A lot of the time the girls can't Ã¡ be bothered or just forget - I usually have to fill in.
sadness,So as to be closer to the university I have left home and moved Ã¡ into Auckland. It now seems as if I have left home - especially Ã¡ my family - forever.

shame,NO RESPONSE.
guilt,I did not attend a social studies observation class for 1 whole Ã¡ week (I am a student trainee teacher). Anyway the other teachers Ã¡ thought this was okay because the teacher I was supposed to Ã¡ observe was not well liked. The teacher was in fact really nice Ã¡ to me - but I wanted to get out of teaching a hard topic he had Ã¡ given me.
joy,Passing my pharmacy exams which meant my tertiary education for Ã¡ pharmacy completed.

anger,Never really had the experience just yet - N/A.
sadness,"This occurred when my girlfriend and I have to finish our Ã¡ relationship due to some circumstances between her and her Ã¡ family. I was really sad, hurt and couldn't really find any Ã¡ reason why am I still living. Is this life is all about ? This Ã¡ was one of few question which crept up vividly every time I Ã¡ thought about what had happened."
disgust,I'm very disgusted when I see people abusing their body with Ã¡ drugs and alcohol. They take advantage of these things usually Ã¡ for an excuse for the fantasies which they like and so they do Ã¡ things stupidly and unjustly.

joy,"Letting Jesus take control of my emotions i.e., ill feeling."

shame,When ditched - divorced by husband.
guilt,When I had to lie about my age to be accepted as a member of a Ã¡ group.

fear,That if ever I was really naughty I would be sent away from my Ã¡ Mum and Dad to another family. I was fostered from age 5 and Ã¡ didn't get to Mum and Dad until I was 6 and then legally adopted Ã¡ at 14.
anger,(1) My father died. (2) My natural father contacted me a year Ã¡ after my father died and this angered me more as I thought he Ã¡ should be dead and not my father.
sadness,My father died. I was away at the time and did not know until two Ã¡ days after.
disgust,A child told me she had been sexually abused by her step-father. Ã¡ I only knew the child and had not come into contact with either Ã¡ parent. I tried to do what was best for the child. The event and Ã¡ the stepfather disgusted me.

joy,"When my lover and I felt like we had gone full circle. And our Ã¡ relationship was new, fresh, vital etc. once again."
fear,"My daughter was 2 yrs she went up to a colt tried to hit it. It Ã¡ turned on her and kicked her over the heart, sent her flying Ã¡ through the air. I left my mother and sister to deal to her as Ã¡ they are nurses. I felt I didn't want to know if she was going to Ã¡ die, it was just too much."

sadness,"The saddest I've ever been was when my lover was killed, Ã¡ hitch-hiking to work."
disgust,With the N.Z. Rugby Union wanting to send the All Blacks to South Ã¡ Africa.
shame,"That my brother and father are into alcohol, two men with Ã¡ priviledge. Not using it positively."
guilt,"When I betrayed my lover, she told me something in confidence, I Ã¡ felt at the time I had to relay the information back to the Ã¡ person concerned, as I felt the situation volitile, did this Ã¡ without telling my lover, she felt like piggy in the middle, as Ã¡ she was not directly concerned. Maybe you could call it gossip I Ã¡ felt different after I had slept on it. If I had waited, thought, Ã¡ NOW I would not have done it."
fear,"I walked up the main street of Auckland at 10 o'clock at night. I Ã¡ expected it to be very active with people, gangs, fast cars etc, Ã¡ thought it was actually quite quiet, though also oppressive. I Ã¡ walked about half a mile and bought a drink along the way."

sadness,"Sitting in a bus, I heard behind, the voice of a girl I was Ã¡ friendly with. After her talking for some time with another girl Ã¡ I decided it wasn't her in fact that someone miming her, which it Ã¡ was when I finally looked. I was talking to a friend at the time."
disgust,Having moved into a flat within the last week I felt some disgust Ã¡ that a bathroom tap had been left to drip with a faulty fawcet.
shame,"I criticised an action of my mother and for the first time she Ã¡ genuinely took notice of it. I felt shame that I was almost Ã¡ taking the part of a husband, or at least an equal which I should Ã¡ not."
guilt,"I felt that I contributed to a possible rift in the relationship Ã¡ between a boy and girl soon to be married, in my flat after I Ã¡ moved in. After stating my celibacy to him which she overheard Ã¡ and didn't previously know about I suspect."
joy,"My friend replying to my letter and again saying he was attracted Ã¡ to me and suggesting we write, talk and get together and see how Ã¡ things went and his suggestion that I could ring and doing that it Ã¡ was really good - though really insane conversation."
fear,"Being sexually assaulted (not rape, but passionate kissing) by a Ã¡ friend's father - he stopped when he was driving me home. I Ã¡ hadn't wanted the lift, had refused 3 times, and then felt it'd Ã¡ be rude to refuse again. Was really afraid of what he might do."
anger,"I live by myself and a few weeks ago was woke by a man on the end Ã¡ of my bed coming up my bed at me. I was really angry, told him to Ã¡ get out. He was surprised, hesitated; I started to move towards Ã¡ him and he backed off - kept telling him - loudly, but firmly to Ã¡ go. Because I'd got the initiative, I succeeded. A very powerful Ã¡ message."

shame,Cannot recall the emotion with any force.
guilt,Slept with someone close to my girlfriend and myself.

fear,"When I decided to leave my steady, secure employment to come to Ã¡ university. Because I didn't know if I could cope with all the Ã¡ requirements of study and also being older I didn't know if I Ã¡ would enjoy mixing with younger people, also financial Ã¡ insecurity."
anger,When a close friend failed to live up to the expectations I had Ã¡ of him - thereby causing pain to his spouse. I believe that my Ã¡ anger was probably a reaction of fear that I wouldn't be able to Ã¡ live up to my own expectations.
sadness,"Departure of a very close friend - for a long stay overseas, Ã¡ sharing in the sorrow of her parents who were left behind."

When I thought about the future, an unexplainable Ã¡ fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright Ã¡ prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my Ã¡ brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue Ã¡ I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased."
anger,The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often Ã¡ grinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This Ã¡ made me angry.
sadness,"When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then Ã¡ and did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives Ã¡ and my tears made me sad."
disgust,"At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid Ã¡ doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch Ã¡ together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had Ã¡ promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime Ã¡ after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize Ã¡ his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a Ã¡ university student and ought to have self-respect.  He Ã¡ disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him Ã¡ and did not want to keep any contact with him."
shame,My friend had many female friends and I thought that they were Ã¡ his lovers.  I would scold him but he did not accept my advice.  Ã¡ Later I learnt from his girlfriends that this was not true.  I Ã¡ felt ashamed at having misunderstood him.
guilt,In the past I used to think that my mother was a very nagging Ã¡ person.  When I started living at the hostel we had little time Ã¡ to meet each other.  Whenever I went home she would take care Ã¡ of me.  I gradually realized that what she had done was for my Ã¡ own good.  So very time I saw her I felt guilty.
fear,"On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was Ã¡ afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very Ã¡ unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of Ã¡ passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to Ã¡ repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results Ã¡ were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a Ã¡ minor in this subject I would be very unwilling."
sadness,This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September Ã¡ I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in Ã¡ the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not Ã¡ find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about Ã¡ sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  Ã¡ I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock.
disgust,"My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had Ã¡ melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played Ã¡ the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell Ã¡ him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right Ã¡ to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to Ã¡ leave the room and go somewhere else."
shame,"Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was Ã¡ working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had Ã¡ joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female Ã¡ classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not Ã¡ fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I Ã¡ realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I Ã¡ said sorry to her and the matter came to an end."
guilt,I lied to one of my best friends.
joy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
fear,My parents were out and I was the eldest at home.  At midnight a Ã¡ male stranger phoned us and spoke to me in a rough language.  I Ã¡ hung up and heard someone walking outside our door.
anger,Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her Ã¡ grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in Ã¡ mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me Ã¡ and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  Ã¡ When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be Ã¡ employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  Ã¡ there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they Ã¡ made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five Ã¡ days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another Ã¡ child to teach.
sadness,I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had Ã¡ prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After Ã¡ three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and Ã¡ failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others Ã¡ would think that I had not prepared for it.
disgust,I was at home and I heard a loud sound of spitting outside the Ã¡ door.  I thought that one of my family members would step on the spit Ã¡ and bring the germs in the house.
shame,I did not do the homework that the teacher had asked us to do.  I Ã¡ was scolded immediately.
guilt,I had shouted at my younger brother and he was always afraid when Ã¡ I called out loudly.
